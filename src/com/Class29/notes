Variables
They hold data
1)one value at a time what if we need to store more data we will have to define that many variables not feasible.

Arrays:
Consecutive memory location pointed by a single variable.
1) Fixed in size once that arrays is declared we cannot  change the size.
2)If we declare a bigger arrays at the start we may be wasting memory
3)If we declare a smaller array we have to do a lot o work to accommodate entries beyond the size of the array

Collections
Is a collections of classes and interfaces that can hold an objects as a unit like arrays but with a lot flexibility.

pros
1) Less code built in method for a common problem we may face.
2) No fixed sizes all the classes in collections framework are flexible
we don't need to declare ate size upfront
3)Memory efficient
cons:
we cannot use the primitive data type in collections framework to overcome this issue have wrapper classes.


What is wrapper class?
Wrapper classes are just object equivalent of primitive types for all of the primitive types. We have wrapper
classes we can use them in collections framework.
