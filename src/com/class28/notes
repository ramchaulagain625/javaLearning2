Abstraction
1) Abstraction is one of the main four OOPS concepts .
2)Abstractions a process of hiding implementation details and showing only functionality
to the user. Abstraction helps use focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.
3)We can achieve abstraction by using
Abstract class
interfaces
4)Abstraction class is a class with abstract keyword that has defines and undefined method
Rules:
1) We can not create the object of abstract class directly .
2)To make a method abstract we use abstract keyword as not access modifiers and we do not provide
the method body.
3)We can not define as abstract method as private static and final
we cannot make an abstract method as private because private methods do not participates in inheritance
 if somethings is not participating inheritance how we can provide the implementation for that entity
why not static?
we cannot make abstract methods as static because we cannot override static method
while abstract methods must be overridden
why not final?
because final means somethings complete and abstract means somethings is
incomplete these two key word contradict each other
.
