Map:
Map is a data structure (a way to store and manipulate data) that stores the data in the form keys and values
Key and values must be Objects.
Index is just a way of acessing the data from your data structure
Maps can have any type of object as their indexes.
Key cannot be duplicate but the Value may be duplicate.
When to use Maps:
1) Fast search because underlying data structure is a hash function that store data in the form of nodes
2) When we want the indexes other than natural indexes like integer.

Types of Maps:
1) HashMap (order is not maintained Fastest) its not thread safe.
2) LinkedHashMap(Order is maintained slower than HashMap)
3) TreeMap(it always store the data ina sorted way)
4) HashTable similar to the hashMap it should be used when we have to write multithreaded code it is thread safe but
slower than HashMap
